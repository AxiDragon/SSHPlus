# SSHPlus
Chrome extension for [https://www.sshxl.nl/](https://www.sshxl.nl/) to facilitate searching for student accomodations.

## Current Features
- Position Highlighting: Add a color to your current position on an accomodation based on how likely you are to be invited for an introduction night or viewing.
- Advanced City Filter: Filter accomodations based on more than one city.
- Seen History: Mark accomodations which you have seen, or hide them altogether.
- Date Sorting: Sort accomodations based on how long you may still respond to them.
- Gender Filter: Add a warning when viewing an accomodation that isn't looking for your gender.

## Installation
I'm hoping to put this on the Chrome Web Store, but until then:
1. Unzip the files you downloaded at [Releases](https://github.com/AxiDragon/SSHPlus/releases)
2. Visit chrome://extensions/ in Google Chrome
3. Switch on 'Developer Mode' in the top-right
4. Click 'Load Unpacked' and select the unzipped folder
